Concentrations in plasma were determined after 7 days of desipramine (50 mg/day) dosing alone, during the 21 days of desipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coadministration (fluoxetine, 20 mg/day; sertraline, 50 mg/day), and for 21 days of continued desipramine administration after SSRI discontinuation. Desipramine Cmax was increased 4.0-fold versus 31% and AUC0-24 was increased 4.8-fold versus 23% for fluoxetine versus sertraline, respectively, relative to baseline after 3 weeks of coadministration. Desipramine trough concentrations approached baseline within 1 week of sertraline discontinuation but remained elevated for the 3-week follow-up period after fluoxetine discontinuation. Concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites correlated significantly with desipramine concentration changes (for fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, r = 0.94 to 0.96; p &lt; 0.001; for sertraline/desmethylsertraline, r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.01). Thus, sertraline had less pharmacokinetic interaction with desipramine than did fluoxetine at their respective, minimum, usually effective doses.</TD>

<TD Align=left ><STRONG>Quote: </STRONG> Route of administration: oral (inferred because IV formulations do not appear to be available for sertraline and desipramine)<br><br>study duration: see below<br><br>population: 17 volunteers (design called for 24 but several dropped out or were excluded due to non-compliance); all participants were extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (o-demethylation)<br><br>ages: mean(std dev): 30.4 (+/-5.2)<br><br>AUC_i/AUC (24 hour): 838 / 611 = 1.37<br><br>NOTE: AUC increase mentioned is for the phase of the study using 50mg of paroxetine.<br><br>Description:<br>The pharmacokinetics of desipramine when coadministered with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline were studied in 24 healthy male volunteers (CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers). Desipramine (50 mg/day) was administered for 23 days in each phase of the crossover study with a 7-day drug-free period between phases. In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive concomitant paroxetine (20 mg/day on days 8 through 17 followed by 30 mg/day on days 18 through 20) or sertraline (50 mg/day on days 8 through 17 and 100 mg/day on days 18 through 20). SSRI treatments were switched between phases. After 10 days of coadministration at the lower dose, mean desipramine maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) relative to baseline increased from 37.8 to 173 ng/mL (+358%) with paroxetine versus from 36.1 to 51.9 ng/mL (+44%) with sertraline; the mean desipramine 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC[24]) increased from 634 to 3,305 ng x h/mL (+421%) with paroxetine versus from 611 to 838 ng x h/mL (+37%) with sertraline; and the mean desipramine trough value (C0) increased from 18.5 to 113 ng/mL (+511%) with paroxetine versus from 18.3 to 21.8 ng/mL (+19%) with sertraline (all increases, p &lt; 0.001). An approximately 10-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC(24) of paroxetine and an approximately 2-fold increase in these parameters for sertraline occurred simultaneously with the desipramine concentration changes. Thus, when coadministered with 50 mg/day desipramine, sertraline had significantly less pharmacokinetic interaction than paroxetine with desipramine at the recommended starting dosages of 50 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively.</TD>

Plasma samples were analyzed for desipramine or imipramine concentration by HPLC with electrochemical detection, and pharmacokinetics were determined with use of noncompartmental analysis of individual data. RESULTS: Multiple-dose, but not single-dose, treatment with sertraline significantly reduced apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) and prolonged the half-life of desipramine relative to baseline. These changes resulted in higher plasma desipramine concentrations, as indicated by a significant increase in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] (22% and 54%, respectively). Both single- and multiple-dose treatment with sertraline significantly reduced the CL/F of imipramine. This effect was stronger after multiple predoses of sertraline, when imipramine Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) were increased by 39% and 68%, respectively. These treatment effects were consistent between individuals.</TD>
