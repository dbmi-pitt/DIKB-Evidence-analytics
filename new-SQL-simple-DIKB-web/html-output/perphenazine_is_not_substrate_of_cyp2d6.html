METHODS: cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction... Ketoconazole inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that CYP3A4 accounted for about 40% of perphenazine N-dealkylation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.The contribution of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25% each as measured by the percentage inhibition obtained by addition of furafylline, fluvoxamine or quinidine, respectively.<br><br></TD>

Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction. RESULTS: CYP isoforms 1A2, 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 were able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine. Reaction velocities and their relative abundance in HLM suggested that CYP1A2, 3A4, 2C19 and 2D6 were the most important contributors to N-dealkylation. Apparent Km values of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 were in the range 1-2 microM, and Km values of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were 14 microM and 7.9 microM, respectively.</TD>

After pretreatment with paroxetine, perphenazine peak plasma concentrations increased twofold to 13-fold (p &lt; 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in central nervous system side effects of perphenazine, including oversedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and impairment of psychomotor performance and memory (p &lt; 0.05). <br></TD>
