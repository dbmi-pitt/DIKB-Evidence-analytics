2265054|erythromycin_increases_auc_midazolam|I score this a possible with the DIPS. Big problem is that IV erythro should not have much effect on oral midazolam until some time has passed for the metabolite to be formed and produce inhibition. I would expect the IV erythro effect to be more on the systemic clearance of midazolam, rather than its first-pass. Comparison to other children does not impress me much. Finally, what 'fruit juice' do you think they used with the pre-op? Patient data relies on a single value at 5hr that appears to be high. What if it is an error? Then there is not much except the kid went to sleep. Nausea and tachycardia probably due to erythro and or atropine. Wonder if he had a brief bout of TDP (due to erythro) causing loss of consciousness that spontaneously reverted. No info given on ECG before transfer to recovery room. All in all, not a convincing case report

asenapine-organon-082009|asenapine_inhibits_cyp2d6|In the curators opinion, the data presented in support of this assertion is confusing -- there is little effect on dextromethorphan, a probe substrate of cyp2d6, but a big effect on paroxetine. Possible other mechanisms involved (protein transport?)
asenapine-organon-082009|asenapine_substrate_of_cyp1a2|In the curators opinion, these pathways were poorly characterized in the pre-market studies of asenapine. For example, fluvoxamine is an inhibitor or multiple pathways according to the 2006 FDA guidance to industry on drug interaction studies yet it appears to have been used to examine if asenipine is a substrate of cyp1a2. Similarly, carbamazepine is an inducer of multiple CYP450s but appears to have been used to infer that asenapine is a substrate-of cyp3a4. In terms of cyp2d6, the in vivo data shown in Table 4 indicates that asenapine is not a substrate-of cyp2d6.

iloperidone-vanda-2009|iloperidone_primary_total_clearance_mechanism_Metabolic_Clearance|While the label states clearly that iloperidone is highly metabolized, the study referred to in the NDA does not appear to provide enought details to infer that more than 50% of iloperidone's clearance is by metabolism
atazanavir-ERSquibb-112009|atazanavir_inhibits_cyp2c8|While the label states that atazanavir is a weak inhibitor of cyp2c8 it is not clear from the label how this was established. In the curators opinion, this statement is not clarified well enough to be used as evidence in the DIKB since many or most substrates of cyp2c8 are also substrates of cyp3a4.
telithromycin-Sanofi-Aventis-052009|telithromycin_inhibits_cyp1a2|While theophylline is a cyp1a2 substrate, it is unclear from the label statement if the increase mentioned in theophylline's AUC was statistically significant.
indinavir-merck-112008|indinavir_inhibits_cyp2d6|The statement that indinivir weakly inhibits cyp2d6 is based solely on in vitro data.
omeprazole-sandoz-022009|omeprazole_inhibits_cyp2c19|While there is one statement that vaguely refers to a potential for inhibition of cyp2c19 by omaprazole ("Other possible interaction mechanisms are via CYP2C19" in Section "Antiretroviral Agents") this statement is not clear enough to add into the DIKB.

16390352|quetiapine_substrate_of_cyp2d6|The in vitro experiment is rejected as evidence for this assertion.It is not possible to say of what relevance the findings are because the concentration of quetiapine in this in vitro experiment was 7-fold greater than the observed C_max at 300mg bid.

11084219|venlafaxine_inhibits_cyp2d6|The study used imipramine to generate desipramine as a metabolite...the changes in AUC appear statistically signficant but those for clearance are barely so.

9205822|venlafaxine_inhibits_cyp2d6|Rejected as evidence against. The experiment only used three livers which might be insufficent for evidence against this assertion.

9024962|venlafaxine_inhibits_cyp2d6|Rejected as evidence against. Alprazolam 4-hydroxylation is not a recommended probe substrate for CYP3A4.
9023308|citalopram_substrate_of_*|The recombinant  enzyme and HML experiments are rejected as evidence for and against. DIKB curators do not currently  accept results from experiments using recombinant cell lines derived from human cells (e.g. lymphoblastoid cells) as support for substrate_of or controls_formation_of assertions. Such evidence is accepted as refuting evidence for these assertions however, this experiment only examined only one of at least three known metabolic clearance pathways for citalopram. The latter issue applies to the HLM experiment and excludes it as evidence against any substrate assertions.
9023308|citalopram_substrate_of_cyp3a4|The concentration of ketoconazole was fixed at a 10 and 100micM in the HLM experiment. Ketoconazole might not be a selective inhibitor for CYP3A4 at either concentration (see for example PMID 17600081).
