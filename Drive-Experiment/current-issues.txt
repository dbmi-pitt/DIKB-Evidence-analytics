##### DIKB Evidence Experiment Updates/Issues
### AS OF: 11/23/15

1. The following drugs have 'in_vitro_selective_inhibitor_of_enzyme' assertions for multiple enzymes:

azamulin - cyp3a4, cyp3a5
itraconazole - cyp3a4, cyp3a5
ketoconazole - cyp3a4, cyp3a5, p-glycoprotein
quinidine - cyp2d6, p-glycoprotein
ticlodipine - cyp2b6, cyp2c19
troleandomycin - cyp3a4, cyp3a5
verapamil - cyp3a4, cyp3a5, p-glycoprotein

2. There are no drugs with 'primary_total_clearance_enzyme' or 'in_vitro_probe_substrate_of_enzyme' assertions for multiple enzymes.

3. Fixing the assertion types has greatly increased numbers of predictions (162% of most-rigourous, 187% of tier4, and 145% of just-labelling)

4. Still getting an error with a contradiction when the FDA 2006 evidence is removed, not sure why, because this isn't the only case where the "inhibits" and "does_not_inhibit" are supported, so it doesn't make sense to me... HOWEVER, I don't want help on this yet, I feel like it's something I can figure out and just haven't given enough time yet.
