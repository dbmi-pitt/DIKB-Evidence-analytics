You may view known and predicted metabolic inhibition interactions for
the drugs in the DIKB at

The following queries show how to get results from the  <a href="http://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu:2020/snorql/">DIKB SPARQL endpoint</a>


<h2></h2>

<p>
Get all drugs in the DIKB that are in vivo inhibitors of CYP3A4 or
known to have an in vitro inhibition constant:
<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  {?s dikbD2:inhibition_constant "cyp3a4"} UNION {?s dikbD2R:inhibits obo:PR_000006130}
}

</pre>
</p>

Focus only on in vivo inhibitors or those that are expected to inhibit because the ratio of Ki to [I] is sufficient to infer in vivo inhibition:

<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?s dikbD2R:inhibits obo:PR_000006130.
}

</pre>

Or...if any Ki will do....

<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?s dikbD2R:inhibition_constant "cyp3a4".
}

</pre>

Give me all drugs that have been shown to increase the AUC of alprazolam:
<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?p dikbD2R:increases_auc ?o.
  ?o dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name "alprazolam".
}

</pre>

What drugs has diltiazem been found to increase the AUC:
<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?p dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name "diltiazem".
  ?p dikbD2R:increases_auc ?o.
}
</pre>


To what magnitude was diltiazem  found to increase the AUC of simvastatin:
<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?p dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name "diltiazem".
  ?p dikbD2R:claim_for_increases_auc_simvastatin ?a.
  ?a dikbD2R:Assertions_numeric_val ?foldIncrease.
  ?a dikbD2R:Assertions_cont_val ?discretized.
}

</pre>

What evidence supports the diltiazem/simvastatin pharmacokinetic inhibition interaction?
<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?p dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name "diltiazem".
  ?p dikbD2R:claim_for_increases_auc_simvastatin ?a.
  ?a swanco:citesAsSupportingEvidence ?ev.
  ?ev dikbEvidence:Evidence_type ?type. # from the DIKB Evidence taxonomy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2783801/bin/NIHMS117019-supplement-02.pdf)
  ?ev dikbD2R:Evidence_numb_subjects ?numbSubjects.
  ?ev dikbD2R:Evidence_object_dose ?objectDose. # in grams
  ?ev dikbD2R:Evidence_precip_dose ?precipDose. # in grams
  ?ev rdfs:seeAlso ?docPointer. # in most cases a PubMed ID
  ?ev siocns:content ?quote.

Which drugs listed in the DIKB are known to be cleared from the body primarily by renal clearance?

<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  ?d dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name ?dn.
  ?d dikbD2R:primary_total_clearance_mechanism "Renal_Excretion".

}

</pre>

Which drugs listed in the DIKB are known to be primarily cleared from the body by metabolism? (NOTE: there are two ways that this is noted in the DIKB. The first is that the primary total clarance mechanism is noted to be "Metabolic_Clearance", the second is that the drug has a "primary total clearance enzyme" -- this is an enzyme by which more than 50% of the drug's clearance known to occur). These conditions are not mutually exclusive.

<pre>

SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {
  {?d dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name ?dn.
  ?d dikbD2R:primary_total_clearance_mechanism "Metabolic_Clearance".} UNION

  {?d dikbD2R:active_ingredient_name ?dn.
  ?d dikbD2R:primary_total_clearance_enzyme ?enz.
  FILTER(str(?enz) != "")}
}
ORDER BY ?dn
